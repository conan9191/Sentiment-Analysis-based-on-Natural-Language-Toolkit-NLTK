Greenlights is a remarkable first book from an already renowned artist.  Kind of a mashup of Anthony Bourdain with Ernest Hemingway, McConaughey tells stories with the aplomb of accomplished raconteur. Part memoir, part life guide and part ethic Greenlights is worth reading for many beyond McConaughey’s fan base; basically anyone who likes a good man’s man adventure story.	4.0 out of 5 stars
Worst book ever written.  The only redeeming value here is that it gives you a glimpse into the mind of a Narcissist.  The writing is, at best, at a Middle School level and the depth of content is yet another level below that.  It’s so shallow that it’s laughable.  Green light is a testament to the craziness our times - that we celebrate complete airheads like MM.  The degree of arrogance and total lack of self-awareness by the Writer/Subject would be shocking if it wasn’t so amusing.  If there is any order in this universe, 100’s of years from now someone will pick this book out of landfill and,after reading the first few pages, be absolutely convinced they have stumbled across one of the greatest parodies ever written about the 21st century.	1.0 out of 5 stars
Amazing book, clever and funny. Not your typical memoir, by design. As a huge fan, I enjoyed it very much. Also just got the audiobook because he narrates it and I wanna give it another round listening to him. If you like him, you’re sure to love it.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Already received and enjoying it immensely. Beautifully written with candor, humor and reflective insight. A great read.	5.0 out of 5 stars

My book arrived in great shape, no damage, tears or nothing. My 14 year old son eyed it so I immediately gave it to him. He read 7 pages. The next day I thought I’d better take a look at it to make sure it was suitable for him. I’ll just say that I’m glad he didn’t get past page 7. Lol, I think I’ll give it back to him when he’s 17 years old or so. As I read more, on page 30 now, I think it’s a great book. Can’t wait to update my review when I’m done. Matthew McConaughey is my favorite man on earth. I love the cover of the book. I love the notes all over and the photographs. I recommend this book.	5.0 out of 5 stars

Question! Why is the dust cover at least an inch shorter than the book . Looks weird. Since it’s for a gift I’m concerned. And it’s a bit curled up at the edge.	1.0 out of 5 stars
I have always liked Matthew McConaughey’s dramatic roles and was anxious to read his book; even pre-ordered it.  In reading about his life, I found I much preferred the screen image more than the individual.  He may have “found” himself, but he lost me.	1.0 out of 5 stars
Absolutely amazing! I have no been able to put it down since I’ve opened the box.	5.0 out of 5 stars
The writing is entertaining, but the message is disturbing. Written by an abused, resilient, survivor who credits his abusers with his success. A better name would have been gaslight, because that's what he's done to himself to justify the horrors of his life. I'm sorry for the pain he went through, but this is not a playbook that anyone ought to follow.	2.0 out of 5 stars
As one who never engages in needless exaggerations, I can honestly say that this is absolutely the worst book  I have ever read.  The blank pages and clippings from scribbled diaries, the graphic regurgitation of scenes from his  egocentric life gave one the impression of the book having been written by a perverted eleven year old boy with no friends to play ball with.	1.0 out of 5 stars
I am a UT Alum and a big fan of Matthew McConaughey, but if you were expecting some thought provoking philosophical masterpiece or anything groundbreaking, you will be disappointed. You can read the whole book in an afternoon. I already gave my copy to a neighbor. (sigh)	2.0 out of 5 stars

He tells about a 100 foot high tree house built with stolen lumber. His brother hitting his father with 2 x 4 in the head twice. Talks about his mother and dad having a fight in the kitchen and finishs with "___" on the floor. Trip through Europe on three motorcycles where he says he rented three new hi end motorcycles for $400 each and the proprietor wanted $12,000. He says they wrecked one in Italy and the proprietor brought a new to them. The only good movie he ever made was MUD.	1.0 out of 5 stars

I knew I needed to read this memoir. Didn’t know why though? But I think I do now. Just finished it. I didn’t grow up with a mentor. A baby needs it’s mother. A boy needs his father. I don’t blame my own for not being there. He was later in life... and that counts for a hell of a lot. Never felt comfortable around men growing up. Didn’t feel a part of the club. Had an incredibly strong mother though. She filled both roles best she could. Did a damn fine job considering. I found myself attaching to characters in films. Actors. They were the only teachers I could learn from that didn’t ask questions at the end of the lesson. I could be a silent student of how a man should conduct himself. I probably built my entire structure of self from a collage of characters in films circa 1983-2003. Of course I had NO IDEA who I was until I was 35. And let me tell you.... I didn’t like the guy that I “thought” I was. I was all the darkness and brood of all of my favorite lost, troubled characters with tiny remnants of light shining through the more redeeming, shiny honorable ones. Of course it would only make sense that I would need another actors book to lead me to the next ascension of my “manhood”.  He made it basic with his approach. I’m going to tell you this story. You’re going to read along. You’re either going to connect the dots and apply... or simply turn the page and move on. I realized that I seriously lack the hard work and conviction to truly climb my mountaintop. Let me tell you... I have some high peaks set for myself. With absolutely NO climbing experience. Want to soar through the clouds like a hawk but I’m scared of heights. Of course I’ve learned a few tricks along the way. I’ve lived a damn fine life by some standards. A calamitous train wreck by others. Earned my scars. Tattooed my place like only a beating chest man can. But deep down inside I still feel like a boy. A boy in a rudderless sailboat.  Seasick. Vertigoed. Virgo-ed. (See what I did there;) Back to the book. I read of a man that I had little interest in. Matthew McConaughey. Always seemed abit too cleancut for me. A bit too All-American. The quarterback. The outdoorsey, fisherman. Cool southern drawl with a laissez faire attitude. Crossbred with a stoned surfer So-Cal vibe. Nah, not for me. I like my actors to be a little rougher around the edges. Razor edges at that. Near death even. *im working on changing that appeal* But his work in True Detective especially perked my ears and eyes. Maybe there’s something more to this Hollywood cowboy. Speaking of Hollywood~ I lived there for  9 years and 8 months. I’m proud of that. Not so proud of my lack of productivity whilst living there but that’s another story for another time. Anyhow, the reason I write this is that I can’t say enough about “Greenlights”. I laughed, I cried, I thought a lot about my life and how it went all wrong. I mean... i don’t want anyone else’s life. I want my own. I just want to taste the sweet, cold mountain air of that damned peak I wish to summit. I just don’t have the tools yet. But I’m acquiring them. This year has been hell for many. But it’s been healing for me. I’ve let go of some serious flaws. Really worked on letting go of that boyish mindset. (While keeping some of the fun parts;) I guess the main truth that I took away from the read was that I have to be MY OWN HERO. The lead of MY MOVIE. Rooting for ME to conquer the mountain. Stop being a silent observer. Waiting for the perfect time. The time is NOW. J K LIVIN. Maybe for those of you that need the same thing in your lives.... That nudge in the right direction. This book can help put things into perspective. It’s written by a man who wants to help his fellow man. Yes, a man that’s lived an extraordinary life. But his story didn’t start out extraordinary. He MADE IT extraordinary. With a little help from some friends~ greenlights *one word*	5.0 out of 5 stars
I bought the kindle edition and read it in two days.  I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are really a fan.  Matthew was great in A Time to Kill and the Lincoln Lawyer but I liked him best in the romantic comedies.  I know that actors want to stretch their wings but he lost me at Dallas Buyers Club.  I am happy that he found the love of his life and is a family man, kind of unheard of in Hollywood.  I don't know why he had to share so much of his personal life...for me I was turned off by that.  Prepare for language and improper conduct but apparently he needed to share it.  I felt sorry for his upbringing by both parents..I'm surprised he survived it!!!  His faith in God is real and I applaud him for that.	2.0 out of 5 stars
Heard about the book on Gary Vees podcast Yesterday, place the order immediately after listening to the interview and received the book today. Got home from the office and four hours later I’m just now taking a break, I’m a little over halfway through the book and I’m forcing myself to pause and die just the first half. i’ve highlighted and tabbed and folded so many pages, wow. i’ve even pulled my 10 and 9 year old sons in to read a few things out loud. they have even asked a couple times “why are you laughing? why are you smiling”.	5.0 out of 5 stars

(this review has nothing to do with the content of the book, since the book doesn’t download and isn’t even compatible with a kindle) idk what this is, whether it’s a scam or just a glitch, but this 6.99 version of his newly released book doesn’t download.	1.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew, LOVE you as an actor.  One of the best ever, buy you really missed the mark here with this book.  What was the point?  To expose your family?  Your love/hate relationship with them?  To show the world that in spite of them you succeeded?	1.0 out of 5 stars
I am not sure what I exp, ected, but I was so horribly disappointed.  I did not even finish the book, and I never  give up on one.  It just made me feel like I was reading about someone I would never want to meet, and whose life I did not find appealing or interesting in any way.	1.0 out of 5 stars

Look I am surprised as you are. I saw Mathew had interviewed with Tim Ferris so I read the sample and then the entire book and I really liked it! Mathew is a wonderful story teller and his life is very interesting. But here’s why I think it is very good—he is a disciplined, authentic person with great values. I love how he listens to his dreams, keeps himself balanced by eating heads of lettuce and Ketchup at 18 when he is an exchange student in Australia simply to do something difficult so his head could get cleared and then goes on and does it the rest of his life! Not the eating head lettuce but listening to his dreams and going to the Amazon by himself and then Africa. He clears himself of Hollywood and overindulgence and too many romcoms. He creates himself ready for Dallas Buyers Club because he knows himself and he prepares and deeply knows his “man”. I didn’t care for most of his philosophizing and ersatz poetry but I loved the meat of the book very much. Greenlight to Mathew: he really is a loving guy, a smart guy, and a wonderful actor.	4.0 out of 5 stars

Looks like a 2nds/surplus product ...not a full price First Edition.  Very disappointed...a purchase that I eagerly waited to receive.  The Amazon photo shows the gold 'book'....but leads you to believe it is a border of the dust jacket.  Found a picture of the book in the author's FB page, based on an interview in UK...and it depicts a full book size dust jacket.  Lends itself to sloppy work.  Low star rating for presentation...haven't read the book yet.  Disappointment overtook anticipation.	1.0 out of 5 stars

This is seriously the most AWFUL thing I have read. If I had to choose one word it would be rambling. I am sure it made sense to the writer and a few of his close friends but without that personal knowledge there are very few areas of clarity. Money wasted!	1.0 out of 5 stars
I love Matthew, always had a school girl crush on him so the book was interesting in the fact that I liked to learn things about his up bringing, but overall the book was poorly written and the cut outs of this journals were not really legible.  It was a tad hard to follow. I kept going back to re-read to see if I had missed something, I didn’t. It just simply wasn’t there.  He came off as very full of himself.  He certainly hasn’t had the struggles that most others have had. Looks like things have always just fallen in his lap.  Overall. I’d say the book was OK, but definitely not anywhere near great.  I saw this on someones review of the book and couldn’t agree more..... “The book has interesting spots,, but were overshadowed by the random, incoherent ramblings throughout.”	3.0 out of 5 stars
I liked the book because it kept me going till the end.  What I did not like was that I was offended by some of the book.  I am glad he learned values from his parents, because some of what they did I thought abusive, as he acknowledged in the book.  Some of his personal habits that he shared so freely were offensive.	3.0 out of 5 stars
This is a book you just can't put down.  I plowed through it at a speed you would normally think of with a trash novel, but it isn't.  It is brilliant, fun, unexpected, and a lot more.  There are nuggets of gold in the life lessons and the convictions he was raised upon. But, mostly it is just fun.  The poetry and bumperstickers just add to the whole experience.  I would highly recommend the audio version with the written.  I actually found myself going back and listening to sections I had already read just to hear him say it.  It is outstanding and honestly I wish it would have just kept going... Maybe another book.... green light	5.0 out of 5 stars
I have had a "mom crush" on Matthew McConaughey for a long time, so I was interested in reading this book.  It's essentially autobiographical, but he has a lot of his poetry mixed in.  Not a fan of that.	3.0 out of 5 stars
I have been reading Kindle Books for years.  First time this ever happened to me.  Book locked up at the 4% point and took several calls to Help Desk.  Had to archive and retrieve everything on the Kindle to continue reading. Happened a second time at the 45% point in the book.  Tech support told me the Kindle was old and probably needed to be replaced.  So I ordered a new Kindle and am awaiting delivery.  Existing Kindle works great for every other function.  Not sure why Greenlights is different.  Gave me 15% discount and $15 rebate toward my new one..  I still don't believe my existing Kindle is defective.  My name is Mike Kress and there is a ticket 80529820894 still open (I hope).	1.0 out of 5 stars
Pretty good book written by one of my favorite actors.  Great job and good insight regarding his path to stardom. Stay humble.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I like Mathew as an actor and a person. I believe we all could have written such a book except we are not Multi Millionaire movie stars. Expected a little more about people he worked with. He mention his Best Actor Award for Dallas Buyers Club but no mention about Jarred Leto winning Best Supporting Actor. At the end he mentioned George Floyd as a martyr but no mention as to what a criminal he really was like holding a loaded pistol to the belly of a former pregnant girl friend who had a restraining order against him for past assaults'.....why the mention in the first place. Was it really sincere or just a bone to through his lib friends in Hollywood. Is their no escape from politics?	3.0 out of 5 stars

Matthew is so much about himself it detracts hugely from a potentially excellent book. Did not go into some dark corners vaguely hinted at that could have added depth. Did not develop others in his life. Only all the wonderful accomplishments of Matthew. It all came just too easy. Matt....read “A pale faced lie” for some perspective on true accomplishment. Maybe some insight on what to do with the remainder of your life. GIVE BACK!	3.0 out of 5 stars

2.5 stars, I should have known better than to go in with high hopes. A few great stories but also a lot of rambling.

Let me start by saying that Matthew Mcconaughey is my favorite actor.  Having said that, this is by far the worst book I have ever read in a life in which I have read thousands of books.  It is filled with the most banal, worn-out aphorisms and trivialities, and stupid nonsense.  Those "famous people" who provided bookjacket reviews must either be close friends of the author, want to be close friends, or just didn't read this terrible book.	1.0 out of 5 stars

Greenlights is a book that I wanted to savor, but instead, I finished in a day...because it was so good I couldn't put it down. MM tells stories that are at once relatable yet deeply remarkable. He's lived an interesting life and a privileged one, though he's also struggled. The way he writes, I often found myself saying, you too? His style is folksy/salt-of-the-earth, and there's a lot of wisdom within the pages. I loved this book, and after reading it, I have a great deal of respect for the author.	5.0 out of 5 stars
McConaughey is an amazing actor, but after reading Greenlights, which I finished in two sittings because it was so good, I think his storytelling ability might be the best thing he has going for him. He is one of those people who just knows how to live an interesting life. One of those people you would stay up until 6AM listening to tell you stories and sharing ideas and thoughts. One of those people everyone else just looks at and says, man, that guy knows how to LIVE. In Greenlights, McConaughey shares all of his insights and wisdom into how to live one of those lives. He can build an amazing page-turning story and interweave lessons to live your life by right into it.	5.0 out of 5 stars
This is an amazingly honest book written by a man who obviously has the self-confidence to not be too worried about what people think of him because he knows who he is.  Sure, there are a few things I was not thrilled to learn but you gotta give the man credit for being so forthright.  I read the book over the course of 24 hours.  It did not disappoint.	5.0 out of 5 stars
This book brought me discernment, discipline, many joyful laughs, and my mindset to a changing point. Matthew conveys his values and themes in ways everyone can understand, and most importantly within thorough examples. Do yourself the favor and give this a read. It's worth your time. Literature like this really does make the world a better place, and has the tendency to bring us together as human beings.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Entertaining and funny. This book is probably exactly what you would expect- it is told in McConaughey's cool, laid-back style and is filled with interesting stories and anecdotes that will make you laugh out loud. He takes you through his life, highlighting the red, yellow, and green lights. He looks back on his past successes and failures and considers how everything led to where he is today. He emphasizes the importance of values and continually trying to improve in this life. The book is interspersed with his favorite bumper stickers and poetry that he has written along the way, a lot of it portraying his philosophic musings.	5.0 out of 5 stars
If you can handle a whole bunch of truth, pick up this book. It's raw and kind of scary. You'll get to see pieces of Matthew that you've never seen before.	4.0 out of 5 stars
I loved the way Matthew wrote this book, using his journal and following him as he navigated his life journey.  It wasn't what I expected but so much more.  I laughed out loud a number of times, shed a few tears, was surprised often by how far he went to find out who he was.  His commitment to wait once he decided the kind of people he wanted to represent as an actor and his wife's support was inspiring.  The people he met a !ong the way were so diverse and interesting.  His acknowledgement at the end of the book  was such a tribute to those who made an impact on his life.  I was deeply affected by his love of family and God. This book gave me introspective in my own life.  I believe this is a must read book for anyone and each person will take away something different.  This was an exceptional book.  Thank you for writing it.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I liked the book, and the man. Matthew grew up in a southern, red neck, one may call white-trash, family, but he learned the right lessons, made good choices, worked hard and became a successful and happy man. All of it while searching for meaning of life and happiness. The memoir is anecdotal life lessons and the folk philosophy Matthew developed. He is an adventurous man who strives to learn. This book follows unusual format and writing style. That didn't bother me.	4.0 out of 5 stars

I’ve read book by actors/actresses but they were not great.  I was hesitant on this but happy I bought it and read. It’s similar to the secret, but one huge difference.  The secret May tell stories but it’s an educational fashion.  This book, it his life and his experiences and the choices he made to not limit himself.  You want to feel bad for him with his childhood, but you feel the pride in him because of the lessons he learned to be who he is.  Reading green lights gave me the perspective that the book the secret tries to teach but more reflective and in depth.  It made me open my eyes to what I already knew just didn’t understand the how.  Until now and I get it.  Great book!	5.0 out of 5 stars
Listening to Matthew McConaughey is like sitting in a small-town bar enjoying a beer with an old high school buddy while John Mellencamp strums his guitar through the speakers—familiar, real, and raw.	5.0 out of 5 stars
This is an eminently readable autobiography-to-date.  Filled with illustrations, including diary entries, poems, lists, and general reflections on life, the book is characterized by honesty, vivid details and philosophic reflection.  It is the kind of book that fans would wish all stars would write (but precious few could).  The most obvious thematic move is the distance between MM's life and the stereotypical life of the Hollywood actor.  Taking a different route becomes a journey to a real route and the trip is never dull.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I don't have power but I  have a wonderful book on my phone to read.  You should read it too.  Stopped to read parts to my husband and grandson.  Stopped for awhile to step out on the patio and video the rain blowing sideways and again when the eye of the storm passed over us.  Like this book.  Like a life well lived with storms and calm, but Matthew keeps on "livin" it.  Good on him.  And I'll take some inspiration from him and try to do more livin than living.	5.0 out of 5 stars

What a well written book! I was interested in reading this because it had good reviews (And because McConaughey is a fellow Texan). I was not expecting this but was pleasantly surprised.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I read this thing wicked fast, it is a book about situations in his life that made him who he is today.  By sharing these events, you reflect back on your past to see where the events happened that shaped you and gave you opportunity.  Definitely worth the time to read it and learn a little more about yourself, gain some courage to take advantage of situations as the present themselves and just keep livin (without the g)!	5.0 out of 5 stars
I think that McConaughey is one of our great talents and reading his account of his life up to now was quite entertaining, educating, and exciting to see what a real down to earth man from Texas with the right upbringing could achieve.  This is a book worth reading again on a regular basis for inspiration of what can be achieved at anytime in one's life with faith, integrity, and a li8ttle grit.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I wasn’t sure what to expect when I picked up a copy of Greenlights. Was it going to be a traditional memoir? Life lessons and wisdom that veered into self help? McConaughey philosophy? Wild, self-indulgent, crazy stories? What I’m finding is that it’s all of these and more. This book, at it’s core, is a love letter to life. ⠀	4.0 out of 5 stars
I like MM as an actor but clearly his “writing” style is not typical of most authors.  I had so many instances (while reading this book) of “why did he include that?”.....it was not a typical memoir as I had hoped.  I don’t think, based on this book, I would ever read another one of his offerings.  I am glad so many people seemed to enjoy it, I was not one of them.	1.0 out of 5 stars

Of the written or musical remedies that would allow any of us to experience laughter, reflection, and ultimately joy in a challenging year, Greenlights is certainly one. Take it literally at face value, as a series of great stories that strung together comprise the midpoint of one’s life, or pause intermittently to consider the cornucopia of messages about choices made as a result of interpreting how life happens for-, not to-, any of us, there’s little way I see anyone not enjoying this gift of a memoir. Thank you Matt. Keep journaling. Keep reaching. You’re not remotely close to being done giving. Cheers.	5.0 out of 5 stars
This book will take you on a series of adventures but its most gripping focus is on the internal journey that we all take throughout our lives. This was written by someone who looked deeply at their own life, goals, and path and audited it at every intersection. We can all laugh at the ridiculous Hollywood stories, the family antics, and the travel logs but more importantly, we can all think deeper about the art of livin because this book exists. I’m glad I read it, and I’m already looking forward to rereading it.	5.0 out of 5 stars

The book was an interesting story about a talented and intelligent actor's life.  It was entertaining but not relatable.  The pitched philosophy of greenlights and how to catch more of them wasn't apparent.  I expected more than an autobiography.  He is a good writer however and this is a candid telling of his story.	4.0 out of 5 stars
Hey I love Matthew McConaughey as an actor. I don't know him personally but have seen interviews with him and he seems like a cool guy to sit down and have a beer with. That being said, I bought this book new for cheap on Amazon as I didn't want to pay $30 for it (and I'm glad I didn't). I am halfway through the book and I am done. Sure McConaughey is an interesting cat and he does have a few stories typical of anyone's life story. Except his story is NOT typical of anyone's life story. It's hard to relate to someone who, at least half-way through the book got about every break ("GREENLIGHT!") and then some. Good for him but the reality is that if he had grown up, say of a different ethnic background, I sincerely doubt he would be where he is today. The book is made up of stories of his upbringing in Texas, the good student, his HIgh School's "Most Handsome" guy, his travels to Australia, motorcyling across Europe and then every Greenlight to where he is today. Like I said, kudos to him, but "ho-hum." I can write my life story and include some of the experiences and insights I have survived with,and it is a helluva lot more interesting than this book, but no one would give a bleep. I just didn't get mostly GREENLIGHTS (mostly RED LIGHTS) but most of us don't and we are thankful when we do get a break. But hey that is REAL LIFE. Anyway I wish Matthew McConaughey all the best (like he needs it) but ths book is highly OVER-rated and I am pretty disappointed that I can't force myself to read the entire book. Anyway this is my opinion. I still think he is a marvelous actor. Thanks! A fan.	3.0 out of 5 stars
This auto-biography by Matthew McConaughey is really amazing. I had a hard time putting it down. I am thinking of giving it as a Christmas gift to others. What an amazing, laid-back guy he is with faith in God and admirable values! It's refreshing to know someone in his business has values.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Beautifully produced book, with lots of photographs and references to the author's journals. But it just was not as interesting. He is a really decent person and while that is good to know, it is not as interesting.... Also the book is a bit hard to follow due to the absence of a narrative. Good vibes though...	2.0 out of 5 stars
Loved this book! As I was reading it I found myself reading it in McConaughey’s voice. Certainly a candid book about his life, sometimes a bit TMI, but that’s just McConaughey and I should have expected it. I enjoyed the unfiltered stories about his life. I’ve lived in the parts of Texas he has and could easily relate.	4.0 out of 5 stars

Highly recommend. It is a great book period. Only positive vibes welcome. Thank you MM for putting a book together. Much needed during present times.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew is obviously an extremely talented man in acting, poetry writing, and insightful/humorous writing.  I gave this book 4 stars as I have only five starred 2 books in my entire life ("The Great Santini" and "To Kill A Mockingbird.")  Funny and self deprocating but holding no glamorous punches.  If you are looking for Hollywood gossip, you won't find it here.  This is HIS journey-not a tell-all on movie making.	4.0 out of 5 stars
I'd like to recommend something for the publisher.  Please be careful about paragraphs that are intended to represent notes from a journal.  Many of those sections in Greenlights were unreadable for me.  This is often true in many books.	4.0 out of 5 stars
I enjoyed reading every adventure, every thought, and pleasure of an actor I've seen grow up on the big screen. Romantic comedies, laughs and fun. My real admiration was Matthews great performance in The Detectives and MUD. He just keeps getting better. Why? Because he's a decent, caring, loving, honest human being. Writing is his natural talent, I hope to see more as his story grows.	5.0 out of 5 stars
This is one of the most interesting and uplifting books I have read in a long time. What an insightful beautiful real story of life. I could relate totally with everything Matthew shared. It is so real that most people could totally relate to it, even though we are not celebrities. Thank you Matthew for sharing your most intimate thoughts with us. This is the perfect time for this book to come out. It has given me hope in these unsure times and inspired me to be more aware, more alive and know myself better.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Interesting work but a little shallow new age hipster vibe. Still have to love naked bongo banging! Over all a solid B grade and I would recommend it.	3.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew McConaughey nailed this book. He pours his heart out with old-school lessons and stories that could be instilled into today's generation to help them navigate. We need to get back to being responsible for our actions and hold our virtue at a high level. It upsets me to see the haters or the radicals give crapy reviews and one star. The bad reviews are from people that think we should all conform to their way of thinking and their only goal is to dismantle this Country and the nuclear family. Thank you Matthew for telling your TRUTHS and stories with your honest and raw personality. I commend you for telling your story the way you wanted us to hear it. I also love your honest and candid attitude by sticking to your beliefs and life lessons. Keep it up, brother. Thanks again, Chris J. Hamilton	5.0 out of 5 stars
I really enjoyed this book. What is there not to like about an autobiography that is funny, yet tender, motivating, yet humbling. The story of the life of an American original and the best part is there is more of that life yet to come and experiences and stories yet to be told. I just hope Matthew has plans for more of the written word to share with us.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Honestly, I thought this book would focus more on his career, but it focuses more on life experiences and I like that about it. He seems like a pretty cool, down to earth, “Here I am, warts and all, take me or leave me,” kind of guy. Maybe the ONE person in the film industry who might be interesting to sit down and have a beer with. MAYBE!	5.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent book. He spoke truly from the heart you saw the good bad and ugly. It has humor and the serious. I’ve always been a fan now I’m a bigger fan :red_heart_selector:	5.0 out of 5 stars
Haven't been much of a reader since high school (decades ago) with books like these, but I'm picking up reading again. Had tons of fun reading each chapter of Mr. McConaughey's life. The part with his brother and father in on the pissing contest to win the dirt bike was priceless. McConaughey does a great job of conveying his feelings at these particular times in his life. Many pleasant surprises with the diary notes sprinkled throughout the book. Well done Mr. McConaughey. Thank you for sharing your life with us. "Begin with the end in mind".	4.0 out of 5 stars
McConaughey’s memoir is a must read. This is not the actor you know, he’s someone way cooler. Unlike most bios which cram the banal and celebrity auto-bios that are self-obsessed, this book is full captivating antidotes, painfully honest introspection, philosophy and words to live by taken from a lifetime of his personal journals. His childhood was full of love and joy, but also quite abusive, yet he didn’t take it that way. And those stories are some of the most entertaining! Check it out, it’s an awesome book.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Interesting book, quick read.	3.0 out of 5 stars
I listened to the audiobook of this and the. bought the hardcover for my mom for Christmas because I liked it so much. The book has its own charm about it audiobook didn’t have (though listening to it from Matthews own voice also had its own charm I’m sure the physical book didn’t have), it includes photos and hand written blurbs he just describes and reads allowed in the audio.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I always knew from what I’ve read and is now confirmed, that Matt was and us a free spirit. In his biography he throws it all out there and by that he pulls us in . Should we all be able to chase our dreams and listen to our inner self as it leads us to where we need to be in this life .	5.0 out of 5 stars
I loved this book.  I downloaded the sample and I was hooked.  Read it in 2 days!  Couldn't stop.  I adore him and love the fact that he shares so openly.  One thing ...i am from Altoona PA.  It's not that bad !  Lol thankyou for sharing your life and I will continue as a big fan!  N. A. From ALTOONA PA!!	5.0 out of 5 stars
I was not much of a fan of this person until season one of True Detective and Dallas Buyer's Club woke me up to his abilities. He is often portrayed in a negative way by the media, but his story explains that view. This guy won every top award an actor can in the same single year. He has an interesting background and I loved reading the unusual format. He sort of free-associates and creates poems that link to his life stage throughout the book. The "Green Light" concept is cool and makes sense if you read it.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I loved reading Matthew's book, but felt it could've gone further.  Hes a movie actor to us laymen (women)  so I missed not reading about his experiences for each movie., of which I've seen them all.  Funny antidotes, stories of co actors.  A little more about the loves in his life.  He is one hellova philosopher,  can really get deep inside and share his feelings in a way I truly, have never read before.  I recommend highly this ride with him.	4.0 out of 5 stars
I am sure mr McConaughey probably deserves a higher rating however after riding shotgun on this literary journey !  I believe he understands the true meaning of... nothing on earth is PERFECT,  thank you for the ride along and may you continue to have greenlights.	4.0 out of 5 stars
I got this because I admire Matthew Mcconaughey. He is a deep thinker and has American Values.  I enjoyed reading about this life; although most the book is more about his message "Green Lights"; giving you the OK to be happy and accept bad as well because good comes out of bad sometimes. I just didn't like how the book was put together. He had copies of his journal and writing on many pages and they were difficult to read. The color was awful and pretty much unreadable.  I think I would like his autobiography better, but this was ok. Not a keeper though for my library.	3.0 out of 5 stars
Overall, it was a well-written book...little out there, yet thought provoking. The actual pictures of his journal entries were illegible (not sure why they were included). VERY DEEP...and at times, not an easy read.	3.0 out of 5 stars
This book is a must read! I just love everything about it! It’s inspirational, it’s educational, it’s entertaining and a page turner! Another reviewer mentioned how the cover to the book doesn’t cover the book from top to bottom. I think it adds style to the look of the book. Honestly, if bothers you remove it. The feel of the book is like no other book! I love it!! It’s has such a soft feel to it like satin rubber lol if that makes sense! To me that adds comfort while reading!! So to any viewer reading the reviews. I did the same. Every viewer love the book! I know it was a must read! Go for it and buy it :)	5.0 out of 5 stars
Love the book... I can hear Matthew McConaughey telling me his story.  It's easy reading.  It will life your spirits.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I saw this book while shopping and was intrigued. Since I'm from Austin I'd been around when he danced naked with congas and did Dazed and Confused.  I heard all the stories but now I wanted to know how this man became the person he is today. I never imagined his journey,  tenacity,  appreciation and sense of discovery. Thoroughly enjoyed this read and the family pictures, bumperstickers, diary, and the fact we are all livin...	4.0 out of 5 stars
I understand that the author was trying to convey an uplifting message of life's ups and downs.  I just couldn't relate to his methods and point of view.  Other people will get a lot of good advice from this book.  It simply wasn't for me.	3.0 out of 5 stars
I could not out this book down. What a great storyteller, with raw, honest emotions. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is searching for God and the meaning of life.  Not only a great entertainer, but a deep person with real emotions.	5.0 out of 5 stars
A great and enjoyable read, teaches you about Matthew but also teaches you about being yourself and having trust in yourself!	5.0 out of 5 stars
I loved this book. I purchased 2 books, one to gift. I couldn’t stop reading and finished it in a day. It’s unapologetically raw, candid and honest all of which I admire. I found it inspirational and left me with a lot to think about. I’ve always been a fan of the actor but now I’m also a fan of the author. As for the short cover, it encouraged me to look underneath which revealed the art on the hard cover. Especially loved the note on the back. Both books arrived in perfect condition.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I really enjoyed reading this book. I was very surprised at some of the things I learned about Matthew. Some of the things I learned, I expected. He's a very interesting man, and down to earth. Some truths in life, he holds dear,  as I do also!	5.0 out of 5 stars
Worth the wait. Preordered and I’ve been biting my nails waiting for it ever since. Finished in 3 days (fast for me lol). Ups and downs, all arounds. A great read of someone’s journey with tidbits, advice and ideas to help guide anyone looking for a glimpse into another man’s perspective on living. Just keep livin.	5.0 out of 5 stars

Well written, enjoyable read. McConaughey is a very interesting soul.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Good book.  Matthew mixes personal stories, success and failure, with his thoughts, writings and poems. It’s a little American success story, a little wanderlust and a little Texas spirit all mixed together.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Best book I’ve read in years... I love that he isn’t full of himself like other actors, he’s very real and caring... he’s the only actor I’d pay to watch his movies anymore... he’s a cut above the rest....	5.0 out of 5 stars
I couldn't help feeling as if he was sitting across from me, talking to my face, laughing with him and trying to listen intently as not to miss out on any of the colorful juicy details.  I admire Mr. McConaughey's  lifelong fortitude to aspire to all that he can be in a world that can pull you down and bury your soul with little regard for struggles. Planning to gift a few of these books this Christmas.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I received this book today and it has some glue-like substance on both the front and back. A full jacket would have prevented this and probably proper packaging (it was tossed inside a large box to bounce about freely on its journey to me). I’m looking forward to reading it, but :woman_facepalming_selector:	4.0 out of 5 stars
GREAT BOOK.	5.0 out of 5 stars
This was a great read, McConaughey is a fantastic writer.  "Life is a verb" and there is no real arrival. His no real arrival attitude helps him enjoy life to the fullest.	5.0 out of 5 stars
An interesting look at what we may or can become and stay true to ourselves.  Some "out there thinking" that must be read several times to absorb, reflect upon and "green lighter."	5.0 out of 5 stars
Have long admired MM's acting in the rebranded phase of  his  career . I did not  know  the  hard  work  of his search for  self, purpose ,  and  a genuine meaningful  life. He took  a  risk writing  this .  The results  are  inspiring .	5.0 out of 5 stars
First off, the writings, thoughts, and truth bared to all about his life lessons was phenomenal!!	5.0 out of 5 stars
I started this book this mid morning, took time to hit golf balls and then came home to read some more.  I finished this evening and truly enjoyed the book.  What struck me, was page 103 in the Kindle.  “We are not born of equal situations, but we should be given equal opportunities!”  I paraphrased.  I am a fan of Matthew McConaughey!	5.0 out of 5 stars
I now might know more about one of my favorite actors than I wanted to but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Mr. McConaughey has certainly led a crazy and active life.  He also has an honest and unique way of writing. I hope to apply some of his Greenlight philosophy to my own life. I wish all the best to him and his family.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Loved this book. Finished in a day! It was fun to "get to know" Matthew McConaughey. He is really funny. Sometimes he can be a little preachy/self indulgent, but I didn't let that get to me at all. I just really liked his style and learning more about him. Plus some really approachable and applicable life lessons.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Fantastic! Read it in a day.	5.0 out of 5 stars

What a wonderful, entertaining read! I can’t wait for it to come out on CD so that I can hear it in Mr. McConaughey’s voice. It’s an unconventional story, unconventionally told and I enjoyed every bit. I only wish that there had been a little more about the making of Amistad because that’s my favorite.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Book was pretty good, kind of short. Got an insight into his "start" and type of person he is.	4.0 out of 5 stars
Greenlights is very well written by author Matthew McConaughey. The book  gives the reader an inside look at this mans life growing up. Reading his story normalizes the everyday lives that we live each day of our lives and gives insight to how he managed the great, good and bad days of his life.	5.0 out of 5 stars
So disappointed the cover (jacket) of this book is clearly the wrong size. It is too small and does not protect the hard covered book.Where is the quality control?	1.0 out of 5 stars

While reading this memoir of Matthew's life, his family, his innermost thoughts and his wise decisions, you see different side of this man, his creativity, his emotions, and his closeness to his God.

This book is such a good read. It’s an easy read but so worth it. It will shock you, it will make you laugh but most importantly it will make you think man this man an amazing outlook on life despite everything. His “green lights” really is about how we choose to look at situation and make our moves in accordance with positive steps to open doors for just about everything in life.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Normally I would not read a Hollywood actor’s prose. Why? Most are disconnected and lost is supposed wealth that exists only in bank accounts.  Here Matthew McConaughey writes from his heart without fear of judgement or persecution.  It , makes it a relatable non-fiction.  And we all love what we can relate to.  I found this book to be very very good.  Highly recommend this across a broad spectrum. From classic, self help, to auto biography.  Superb.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I hate giving book reviews.  I enjoyed reading parts of this book.  Sometimes I just wanted to say "meh".  I am glad I read it, not sure I have many takeways.  I usually hope for one or two.  Perhaps too much hype about the book.  I do love the actor and her is a decent story teller.	3.0 out of 5 stars
I read this book front to back in 6 hours. I couldn’t put it down. It’s worth the read. The first pages are intense.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Bravo Matthew McConaughey - a memoir that does not self-serve or laud “the business”, but offers us the truth of values ingrained by loving parents, accepts experience as part of life’s journey to Self, and shares the “person” of who he really is. A beautiful read.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew did a wonderful job story telling. This book was so enjoyable and fun. Especially loved his stories about his family and his youth. His student exchange program tales had me laughing so hard my sides hurt.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Alright, alright, alright...this book is as entertaining as the actor. Lighthearted while poignant, specific yet approximate, the story we need now to obfuscate the negative pall. Enjoy the vignettes and relate to the diary...my only question is after spilling your family guts--why be coy about a nebulous "family emergency" near the end of the story? To employ that term only invites the reader to demand: what emergency? Should have skipped over that or described it differently. Regardless: a lovely read, inciteful, bongo pounding fun!	5.0 out of 5 stars
Highly recommend this book. This moved past mediated schlock, and let you see the author, warts and all. The storytelling is authentic. There’s more to his story, and I’m glad the veil was pulled back.	5.0 out of 5 stars

The most life changing book you will read. I read 150 pages in one day. Completely mesmerized, I felt like he was there with me while I was reading. I laughed, cried, and related with him down the the deepest levels. For some one who doesn’t like to read and finds it boring at times,  this book is really for a experienced reader or beginner.

I had my utmost respect for Metthew since forever, and even before his Mcconaissance era in Hollywood. And if you also did feel that way for this guy, or even if you have no clue who he is, please delve into his journey. It's just a thrill ride and it will make you realize why his approach to life should be the GO to for anyone really. He certainly opened my eyes by seeing the world and life through his. In his own words... A Love Letter to Life.	5.0 out of 5 stars

I went in reading this book with little expectation.  I'm a fan, so I figured there would be some funny stories about his career and such.  I read the book start to finish in one night.  Could not put it down.  One of the best, motivational, uplifting views I've read in such a long time.  I was enamored with who candid and poetic he is.  It was one of the best things to come out of 2020!  Do yourself a favor, carve 4 hours out of your day, grab a coffee, a blanket and enjoy the words.  You won't be disappointed.	5.0 out of 5 stars

Just took a break from reading it since the minute the delivery guy dropped it off after several hours to send a link to some of my friends to read/buy it. I've dog-eared several pages to come back to and re-read. Excited to finish it today.	5.0 out of 5 stars
TOO MUCH OF A BIG EGO	2.0 out of 5 stars
Cannot put this book down. Definitely recommend!	5.0 out of 5 stars
What a great inspiration. Written as if Mathew himself is sitting beside you telling his stories. It’s not often a biography can have you looking at your own life with such clarity. It reminds you of who you are, what you value, and the value you should see in yourself. His book is a story, journal, inspiration and a reminder that your story begins with YOU.	5.0 out of 5 stars
As I have never cared for movie stars I don't know why I read this. I don't watch movies. Nevertheless, it was rather interesting to follow his decision-making.	3.0 out of 5 stars
I did not understand why the cover was too small. It took away from the aesthetic of the book. It was odd. Is this a packaging issue or how the cover is. It looked as if someone copied the cover and placed it on this book.	3.0 out of 5 stars
this is literally the first “modern” autobiography of sorts that I actually enjoyed.  Not a memoir of “how awesome I am” or an apology of “how awful I was”.  Rather, this is a great read about a man who learned to know and love himself and the world which surrounds him.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Such an inspirational read.  You live life by your rules which is what has made you such a success in love, life and career.  Thanks for sharing this with us.	5.0 out of 5 stars

This book is an awesome ride. It's a fast, fun & raw autobiography written by an artist, and it's filled with many heart-warming & rending stories that are all-laughs on one page and all-tears on the next.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Interesting for sure, but so grounded that it's vulgar at times and uncomfortable.  Matthew is intense to be sure as hell and brimstone have nothing on him.  I find his novel to be a yellow light as one should be introspective to read it or it could be a bit much.	4.0 out of 5 stars
A little self-indulgent, I don't think he had a ghostwriter. Was an ok read but didn't blow my socks off the cover was nice	3.0 out of 5 stars

I bought this book for my husband. He likes to read short stories, although this book isn’t a short story read, it is set up with lots of pictures and the pages are broken up where it keeps your eyes busy!	5.0 out of 5 stars
I am loving this book and I can't put it down.  GenXer's will relate to many passages and details.  Matthew invokes the American spirit with his experience, thoughts, notes, weirdness, western travels and aspirations.  No narcissism here, just a man presenting his thoughts about life.  I bought 10 copies for for bro's as Christmas Gifts! do the same	5.0 out of 5 stars

This is more than an autobiography, its an inside job on going back and understanding a journey to project for the future. It was exploring and understanding author’s choices, forgiving and congratulating himself in the process.	4.0 out of 5 stars
I have a different opinion of Matthew after reading this book. I find him to be humble, a hard worker and thankful for what he had earned.	5.0 out of 5 stars
An amazing read! So insightful about how to live your best life - but laughing the whole time! I have always loved all of McConaughey’s work, but getting to see how he was raised and brought up was so interesting and fun to read. Always great to read about another fellow Texans, loved all the similarities in his life I could relate to living in this great state!	5.0 out of 5 stars

I bought this book for a couple of friends for Christmas and very carefully read one of them. It is a very interesting read, not a typical autobiography.

I’ve read many “self-help” books (although I know this is not) and have been in a rut for quite sometimes - coming up on a year. After reading this book I swear my days have gotten better. Matthew’s way of going about life, it’s lessons, and his comedic nature really makes you read the whole thing in one sitting. So fantastic.	5.0 out of 5 stars

This book is divine. It's a reality check in the best way. It's an accountability entity. It's introspection for the sake of moving one to introspection. If Mr. Mcconaughey's array of acting performances were displayed, forming one script, this is what the product would be. A joy to read. An absolute Joy.	5.0 out of 5 stars

This book reminded me of Mark Manson’s recent works.  It is an unapologetic analysis of a hero’s journey and a quest for mastery in a craft.  The book feels like a “fireside” chat with a conversational flow.  There are a lot of profound take-aways, and you will not be disappointed.	5.0 out of 5 stars

This is a must read. I am a no nonsense non-fiction, looking forward any good historical, analytical book-type of active reader.

First of all, others may like this book because they have different criteria for a "good read" than I do.  That said, I didn't really like this book.  To me, it was like this book didn't even need to be written.  What was the point?  What message was he really trying to send by writing this book?  It's filled with stories from his life that are rambling and disjointed.  The only "theme" to this book is that Matthew McConaughey loves life, feels fortunate, loves to smoke a bowl of marijuana and drink, and doesn't take life very seriously.  I think it's great he's a happy man and has traveled the world in search of himself, even going so far as to take a solo trip to the Amazon River to get out of Hollywood and his own head.  He's obviously a down-to-earth man and doesn't consider himself to be the typical Hollywood movie star.  For me, the downfall of the book is his purported "insight" into life after traveling solo and spending time with the natives in less-traveled areas of the world.  He admits that he considers himself a poet, but what from I read, he's writing it while stoned.  The biggest disappointment for me was his glossing over his screwed up childhood with a violent father and mother.  He says he doesn't regret being raised that way.  Well, it apparently hasn't hurt him any because he talks about how wonderful his life is and that he wouldn't have had it (his childhood) any other way.  For all of his talk about insight, this comes as the biggest shock of all.  His dad's rite of passage for his boys was to take them on physically to see if they could take their old dad.  Matthew had no problem with that.  Okay.  I get it.  He's a good ole' boy.  But one of his brothers ended up knocking out the dad cold during his coming of age brawl with dear old dad.  Matthew writes about this and other violent family episodes like they were funny.  Overall, this book made me see him in a different light and not in a good way.	2.0 out of 5 stars

The reading level is about middle school. definitely pass on this and dont waste time reading something that adds no value to your life - just a time drain. I  like him as an actor but this book really makes me think twice about the guy. He has a lot of opportunity here to talk about important issues facing society today and instead really just puffs himself up for having pursued selfish interests.	1.0 out of 5 stars

After about 25 pages of scatter-shot points (!?!?) with no subject/verb construction, I returned the book to my library.  There was no theme, no “story”—nothing to look forward to learning or reading. Maddening that it used b/c repeatedly (couldn’t spare the full word?).  I absolutely love him as an actor, especially in the “Lincoln Lawyer,” and his ads for Lincoln autos. He is NOT a compelling author.	1.0 out of 5 stars

Being a Matthew McConaughey fan I was excited to listen to this book - especially since he is narrating.  I did enjoy hearing the stories of his childhood, parents, and how he got into acting and so forth.  The parts I didn't like so much were the "note to self" and "prescribe" scattered throughout.  Honestly, my eyes glazed over during those parts.  Too many euphemisms for my taste.	3.0 out of 5 stars

I am so glad I didn't actually have to PAY to read the first couple of chapters of this book...what a waste of money that would have been!  I've always loved Matthew, but this book sucks and really lessens my opinion of him.  I really don't understand all of the great reviews...	1.0 out of 5 stars

Narcissist? It **is** a memoir so you know it is the author writing about the author. It is definitely a short read. At times funny. At times sad. At times embellished. At times truthy. Well written... I don't see anything wrong with the concept but I get how people could be put off. I some ways this book is reinforcement of a celebrity's personal branding. In other ways it is a rom-com of written words. For the author the catharsis was the making of the book; the journey to the product, not so much the product on the shelf.	3.0 out of 5 stars
At times you feel the Amazon reviewers are quick to give 5 star reviews because they are either fans or are starstruck, but as a neutral reader to me a five star review to my mind, at least,  means "excellent".  While this book was a very good short read by no means would I say it was excellent.	3.0 out of 5 stars
I listened to the audiobook version of GREENLIGHTS cover to cover. Immediately I recognized Matthew McConaghey’s voice. His storytelling throughout is well done and interesting. His stories about his year as an exchange student in Australia or his childhood and life with his siblings and parents were interesting. His story about being arrested on a quiet street in Austin, Texas for playing his drums and smoking his bong in the early morning hours was another great story in GREENLIGHTS.	4.0 out of 5 stars
NOTE TO SELF: well any one reading (listening to it) i would say it is NOT meant for children's ears ... or any one who is offended by cuss words ... and let me tell you i love MM and his humor. i always enjoyed his movies ... for me i was hoping certain movies that i personally love would have been more focused on ...but it is funny how .. i mean i get it .. as an actor/actress you want rolls that will make your career ... appear ... greater than ... that you are stretching yourself and your skills ...but for me he is a happy go lucky dude ... not the cussing person that apparently he is??! i would think that you would want to raise children that would not talk like that. i was raised in a family where the first time i heard my Mom say the "s" word was when she dropped a gorgeous salad she has made ... now that is a time to say a word like that ... GOOD REASON. .. i mean i get it ... if you were raised like that ... so be it ...but it really stinks when you have folks like myself who wanna live in a world where it not front and center all the time??! u know??! i understand. i can not be the only one. it has become such a main stream kind of thing ... plain annoying if you ask me. i felt some sections were a BIT TO "TMI" to too too much information ... i mean i am glad that MM has a great sexual relationship with myself and his wife ... HOORAY!! but come on how ... less is more, thanks!! i would think ... since he went there ... i am going to go there as well .. i have never been a man and will never be one ...but i would think during those moments you would be thinking how great that moment feels not a great life plan ... but apparently for him he is figuring it all out ... i guess u have to take it ... this is funny. there are so many funny ... snot coming out your nose kind of moments. i don't really think he has had any that heartbreaking moments .. did he skip them .. not sure ... i mean loss of a parents ... is huge .. i can not imagine ... i am not making light of it ... just .. i would think when you look back over you life ... you tend to sugar coat a lot of the stinky moments...  GREENLIGHT!! personally i wish some1 in my kind of situation would write a book. not every one is a step by step ... all great moments happening in order ... you know. life stinks at time ...it is normal. but i you know what i think i would love to meet his MOM ... she sounds priceless. what a gem. he is so lucky there. but i am kind of shocked by the movies or shows of his life he thinks are great ... i am happy that i listened. it did add to my life ... didn't take away ...but it is not a kind proper listen. i love his Lincoln commercials, one liners ...he is just funny to me. i love his style. i think he is one of the more attractive folks within Hollywood.	4.0 out of 5 stars

If there is any autobiography that readers should listen to as an alternative to reading, it is this book. Authors who narrate their own audiobooks often fall under harsh criticism because, more often than not, they are not professionally trained voice actors who can render the best service to the material they're working with. Matthew, reading his own book, is absolutely golden. That characteristic voice you'd recognise in a crowded hall with your eyes closed, the wicked chuckle, the Texan drawl that hooks you and keeps you with him every step of the way - all of these things add to the living, breathing, vividly recounted tales of life McConaughey shares. This is not a tell all - at  least, it isn't one that needlessly shames other people who have affected or have been affected by Matthew's life. Told with unwavering humour every step of the way, McConaughey nevertheless tackles deep and challenging topics and themes that are central to life - not just his, but anyone's - in a way that renders his 'bumper stickers', 'notes to self' and 'prescriptions,' instantly relatable. Take it or leave it, readers will gain something from it, even if it is a mere chuckle at an amusing anecdote or insider information they never knew about a favourite movie. This is an exceptional audiobook and autobiography by an extraordinary man. Listen to it!	4.0 out of 5 stars
Great thoughts about life and moving on. But, not always relatable to the average Joe/Jane.	3.0 out of 5 stars
This is a book is outstanding. I have about 1 hour left, and I just bought it this morning. We all know Matthew has a way with words when he talks about any subject. Hearing his descriptions of his life and how he can to be where he is, takes my appreciation of him to the next tier.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Not very good, sounds like nice guy but not very good	1.0 out of 5 stars
This book was OK and sometimes annoying to listen to. MM seems like the guy you’d love to hate if you knew him IRL. Greenlights is a reference to positive signals that his life is heading in the right direction. He sounds a bit narcissistic to me. From “best looking” in high school, getting free rides from folks or smuggling in a “seeing eye dog” - the book reeks of privilege that comes with charm and good looks. Then a bit whiney when he decides rom coms are no longer his thing.	2.0 out of 5 stars
He's got a ton of hard to follow philosophy but not much that will stick with me.  He shares some good stories and it made me laugh at times, but overall is was full verbal sludge.  I'm pretty sure he was high when writing quite a bit of it, and it meanders to nowhere.  I found myself speed reading though most of it.  I like him as an actor, but not so much as an author.  Sorry MM, you are not as interesting as you think you are.	3.0 out of 5 stars
I was so looking forward to this memoir, I think McConaughey is a great actor, with over 30 movies in just over 20 years.  Married with 3 children, he only married his Brazilian American wife after she became pregnant with their third child.  McConaughey grew up in a dysfunctional family, the youngest of 3 sons.  His parents married each other 3x and divorced twice.  There were often vicious battles between the couple yet McConaughey seemed to love both parents and, he seemed to seek his father's approval - at least it was evident when he told him he wanted to give up law school for film school.	2.0 out of 5 stars
Part memoir, part advice, part poetry - Greenlights is McConaughey's love letter to the world. He had an unconventional childhood and the journey into acting was less meandering than most. His stories were not just interesting but genuinely well written. He sprinkled in tips and advice throughout the book based off what he learned but it's not preachy - it just goes with the flow. I always thought he was a bit of a hippie but after reading this book I know he 100% is! From bongo-ing naked to having wet dreams that alter the course of your life to living in an airstream for years - Matthew is the man. He lives life on his own terms and it's not always sunshine and roses (although it is more often than not). He does what he wants and he's reflected a lot about how he got there and where he's going. Interesting, fun, and all around good celebrity memoir. I loved all the photos and notes with advice (the poetry was so so - but it did add to the book even if I didn't love it).	4.0 out of 5 stars

I purchased this book hoping to find words of wisdom as I’ve heard from the author in some of his commencement talks. What I got was a disjointed autobiography that was full of drivel and obviously written by a narcissist. Does he really believe we care about his self gratification in someone else’s home or his “Wet Dreams?” I wouldn’t recommend this book to anyone and plan on recycling it. What a waste of time reading this junk.	1.0 out of 5 stars
I first heard about Green lights from a YouTube channel interview Matthew McConaughey did. Intrigued, I purchased the Audible book version. Can't say that I've seen much of Matthew McConaughey's body of work with the exception of Dallas Buyers Club which I thought was excellent and for which he received and Academy award as best actor. I'm going to have to take a look and more of his work after listening to this book. You may disapprove of some of the things he's done in his life, but you won't ever accuse him of not being brutally honest and genuine. He never describes with shame his lower middle class blue-collar up bringing. His greatest strength appear to be his willingness to face the good the bad and the ugly, as just a part of the natural process of life. To pay attention, to learn and to realize that every missed fortune and hardships can also lead  to new opportunities or as he frequently references"Green lights“. I highly recommended, the audio version as the narrated by McConaughey displays his skills and depth as an actor with many great performances to come.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Alight , Alight, Alright!! Greenlights is a remarkable work from a remarkable actor. I am in love with his authorship skills navigating various phases of his life's expedition. The book is informational, motivational, emotional, inspirational, funny, philosophical and exclamatory. I heard the audio version which was 6.5 hours long. Thought it would easily take days but I was so hooked to it that I was able to read, understand, imbibe and enjoy his experiences in less than three days. With his deep, rich, magnificent baritone voice and with his one of a kind modulation, Matthew drew my attention at multitude of occasions and made be present and involved with this unflinching narration with intimate details of the scene and characters. You can't help but visualize every single character, scene and moment he dealt with. I have never read/heard a memoir that is so unconventional, unflinching, candid with so much depth, passion and intensity.	5.0 out of 5 stars

I listened to this book; Matthew McConaughey narrated it himself.  At first, I was put off because I felt he was over-emoting and it felt like I was listening to a very passionate sermon.  Also, his "greenlight" and "bumper sticker" points were rather abrupt.	3.0 out of 5 stars
Dear Matthew,	5.0 out of 5 stars
I read all the 1 star reviews after having read the book. All the negative comments are exactly the opposite of how I feel. I would love to meet this man and his family. They sound fun, deep thinking, caring, supportive and most importantly loving. For those that are disappointed that he is not the same "person" you see in the movies, you're just ignorant.  It's a testament to his skill as an artist that he is able to play such diverse characters that you believe. The man is raw. He says what he thinks and lives what he feels.  He is a philosopher.  If you don't like any of that, don't bother reading this.  He has lived an amazing life. I am envious of his dedication to himself and his pursuits. It takes strength to do what he has done. I am shocked (and happy) that he found a person to share his crazy life. She must be an amazing person. I'm sure she has some more great stories to add to his. Maybe book two...?! Lastly, the few reviews that said he was a poor writer just aren't paying attention.  You just don't get it. I think your expectations of the characters he plays overruled your ability to appreciate this book. Take a leap and try something new. You'll either love it or hate it. Not sure there is a middle on this one. I borrowed it from the library and am now buying it from Amazon.  Not sure if I want kindle or audio or both. The audio version is THE BEST.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I was a big fan of Matthew's shirtless beach behavior and the Romcom genre.  So I went into this book with a preconceived opinion of "Seriously?  What can I learn from this guy?" :face_with_rolling_eyes:  Hes cute and all, but..."	5.0 out of 5 stars

This is a a surprising and remarkable book.  Prior to reading it I had an awareness of Matthew McConaughey as an actor.  So, when I picked up this book I was interested but not expecting much more than a movie bio or entertainment driven book.  This is so so much more!  After reading through it, I am sure that I will not only read again many times, but that it may be one of the ten best books I have ever read.  It is certainly in my top 10.  It was that good.  I have already sent it as a gift to my son, and I plan on sending it to more people this Christmas.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I have to admit, it took decades for me to warm up to Matthew McConaughey. It was his movie, Mud, that tipped the scales completely in his favor. Brilliantly acted; unstrained; unfeigned. Then I saw an interview with him about his new book and had an Audible credit needing to be used. Super thankful for this purchase. Once more - brilliant. McConaughey's use of language, his whip strike wit - coupled with the natural endowments of the gravelly grit of his voice and the intrigue of his Texas accent - have all made for the most pleasant and entertaining adventure in listening. What sneaks up from behind are the life lessons that wrap up all his stories with little "green light" ribbons and bows. An absolute "yes!"	5.0 out of 5 stars
Loved this that came at the right time in my life, as many things do. Love Matthew and his journey. Recommended.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Audible version. I like anything that shares individual philosophy, however I must admit I was disappointed.  How can a man with such extensive life experience and luck come to the conclusion that life is to be lived, but don’t get caught. It was all about ME. Everyone else is supposed to live for me and my wants. I shouldn’t have to do anything I don’t want to do and I’m willing to throw whatever tantrum I have to to get my way. Definitely a democratic stance...just don’t get caught. Sigh	3.0 out of 5 stars
I like the fact to where he says be yourself and to inspire people to not be hard on yourself. He also tells you that you need red and yellow lights with the green lights. You have to have ups and downs in life or your life would be perfect and nothing , but green.  It is an inspiration to my new book Wild Animals to A to Z and I did the whole book myself and I'm a nature photographer too. It teaches kids about learning animals with my photography and I have a learning disability. You can do anything you put your mind too and It is a good idea to learn how to get out of your comfort zone. His book should inspire many to be yourself and we need this book right now , in a world that needs a lot of love. I bought his book too and it will help me to learn that no one is perfect.	5.0 out of 5 stars

This audio book was such a breathe of fresh air ! I was already fan of Mathew McConaughey , but this book connects you with a bit more of who he is and how he came to be.

Celebrity autobiographies are as common as fleas on a stray dog. And often less interesting. Matthew McConaughey’s book is authentic. His parents, his childhood, his luck, and his life view are all here without genuflecting to priorities or ghost writers. The book reads like a long satisfying conversation with an old friend who cares enough to be honest with you. Having read 100’s of autobiographies, this belongs on my very short list of memoirs I recommend to others.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I listened to this book while driving for work.  I drive about 4000 miles a month. So... I  Having this author read this book is priceless. There is no voice actor trying to get the right inflection on what they think the author is trying to say, it is the author, the person who lived the life being described. And his delivery is magnificent. You feel like he is telling you the story, to you, not voice acting. He wants you to understand his story and learn from his mistakes and successes. He is very lucky but he made most of his own luck. He knows he hit the genetic lottery but understood that only gets you in the door, skill and effort keeps you in the room.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I really enjoyed reading this book.  His is definitely representative of his personality that I have seen in interviews, he seems very down to earth and genuine.  He isn’t bragging about his good fortune in life, but saying he has had many experiences and paths that have led him in many directions to where he is now, and not one should be discredited, or necessarily considered the right way t go or the wrong way to go, it was just his path.	5.0 out of 5 stars

What interesting stories with some insights and wisdom learned.  Sometimes, it's better not to know exactly where your stars come from and where they go on their spiritual quests... toss in some drugs, arrests, and method acting and you can see where the stereotype tinseltown celebrities come from - in this case Texas.  This is at times a shocking and "R" rated book.  Listen to the preview and read some reviews.  I would not recommend it for most people as it is more of an insider Hollywood Stories that 'normal' people outside of Hollywood would not relate to.  That's how far out, sometimes dark, and strange these tails are in the crazy surreal world of Hollywood.	4.0 out of 5 stars
I received this as a gift. I wanted it because I like the parts he plays and the roles he chooses.  Of late I have been watching his video's and was taken by the honesty of his concern for the purest part of us as a people. He has a depth I wasn't expecting. I was compelled to dig deeper.  He has been journaling since he was young and there is a real Huck/Finn flavor to his story telling. The silver linings always offered. The lessons conveyed. The motivation presented. He is an optimist that doesn't ignore the bad for the good. Have I read better written books?  Sure. But  I have never listened to better conversations. Approach this book as you would an evening around a bon fire and you will beg for the embers to continue glowing and the sun to stay asleep. It only takes a page before you hear his voice speaking what your eyes are seeing. Allow that to happen. Take the time.  I am the better for the reading...we all need this kind of experience this year. Thank you for taking me on the trip your stories reminded you of.	5.0 out of 5 stars
This book is a great departure from most celebrity autobiographies. It's well written and insightful and brutally honest. The stories of his childhood are a bit heartbreaking, as his parents seemed like lunatics and his having to beat up a bouncer to gain his father's respect seemed like a tragedy. But the best parts of the book are really about self realization and coming to terms with fame. I also really liked the way that he deals with adversity. This book was inspiring in these times of great stress. Big lessons here. I don't think it makes sense to be bothered by egotism in the autobiography of an actor. It comes with the territory.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Greenlights; The actor on on his 50th birthday, decided to look back and went into his journals that he wrote since age 12, and found something amazing and a lesson for everyone. He found that life is full of “greenlights”, meaning all those positive things that happen to you. Yes, we also have yellow and even red lights, but those eventually change to green when you look back in the rear view mirror of life. A very enjoyable reading.	4.0 out of 5 stars

Matthew McConaughey reads his own unconventional memoir as a script, with all the emotion, humor and honesty we've come to expect from this exceptional artist.  At times I felt we were sitting on a porch, gently rocking, sipping (whatever), and he's just talking, jumping up from now and then, waving his arms and laughing and wiping tears all at once.  Taken mostly from journals he kept, and relating his sometimes hilarious life, with the main constant always being family.  He says that being a father was always what he wanted to be most of all, and when he checked that item off his bucket list, you want to cheer.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Written from the viewpoint of a man who scored a series of perfect swishes in basketball and never looked back. "Wow, all these traffic lights are full green, man!" Get all the chicks, get all the movie roles with just a few bumps at the start but then full faucet once things get going. Have all the friends and the respect, have everyone just automatically like you because of the way you look and socially always coming out on top of the pack, green lights, man! Now looking back sitting on a pile of recognition and money and with a family, you too can marvel at my life and hopefully experience green lights too.  If you are good looking and famous.	1.0 out of 5 stars
This is the sign we tend to ask the universe for, this is the warm hug we crave after a shitty day, this is the high five we need when we think nobody appreciates the extra mile we've gone. "This is a love letter to life" as Mr. McConaughy puts it, and Love is everything except what we see in the movies.  This book felt like a person. It was more than words on paper or motivational quotes. This will fan the flame of the dreams you thought you've put away for good.  It'll remind you of the promise you made to yourself a long time ago about reaching the best version of yourself and never letting go no matter how bloody it gets.  It'll take you back to the point in your life when you decided you weren't going to live a mundane life. Pick up a copy and let Matthew McConaughey serenade you out of whatever funk you're going through with his mighty chest bump hum ;) Alright?	5.0 out of 5 stars
This was one of the best books I've ever read, and also THE single best audiobook I've ever listened to. The legendary actor gives an equally legendary performance on Audible. I was left with my jaw agape on every chapter. Truly a masterpiece, and I would love to read more of his work. As an actor and producer, he really does have a poetic, wondrous way with the written word.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I never thought Mr. McConaughey was anything more than a pretty face, he's a fine actor, but did he have any depth? Turns out, he does. He's led a lucky life and he knows it, but it was insightful. I laughed, I got a knot in my throat a couple of times, I smiled a lot, but in the end... I found an ironic inspiration in some of his life lessons and thoughts. Not how to be an actor or any nonsense like that, but just how to view the unsuccessful times in your life. Maybe he's been lucky because of that. Regardless, I enjoyed it - get the audible version because his reading of his own book comes with the inflection and that isn't there when you are reading. Laugh! Live! Be inspired! Isn't that what we all are wishing for?	5.0 out of 5 stars
FANTASTIC!! Seriously, anyone who left a negative review is questionable. I highly recommend the audiobook in which Matthew narrates himself. It’s the icing on the cake. Puts you in every moment in time along with him. A good time, hot tub time machine in the form of an audiobook. On my second listen now. It’s clever, funny, REAL, raw, IMPACTFUL and RELEVANT. Now there needs to be a movie:dizzy:	5.0 out of 5 stars
I rate this book Alright, Alright Alright!!!	5.0 out of 5 stars
I am listening to this book on audible and enjoying every bit of it. Once I am done I plan to order a copy to have to hold and to read again. It is just that good! It makes you think, it makes you laugh and at some point your wishing you could have had a life filled with so much experience.  He has lived life his way on his terms and he is still figuring it all out day by day! An incredible read, not even done yet and kinda sad that its coing to an end but again i will be grabbing a hard copy :) Thank you Mr. McConaughey for this gem!	5.0 out of 5 stars
I got this because he read it himself.  Love his voice!  The story was a good one.  Talks a lot about everything leading where it is meant to even with rough times along the way.  Just wait the green light is coming.  However since I don't have $$$$$$$ to just pack up and take a world adventure on a whim as he had.  Or travel the roads of America in a RV - which I would love but - you have to be able to finance it.  He had a lot of luck along the way.	4.0 out of 5 stars
My husband and I have always liked Matthew McConaughey. We have watched every movie and TV show that he’s in.	5.0 out of 5 stars
WOW! What a life this man has and is having. I bought the physical book which looked awesome with many photos and “bumper stickers,” as McConaughey calls them, but I listed to the audiobook. Listening to McConaughey tell his own stories was as if I were sitting down having a drink or dinner with him. He is vivid and descriptive in telling his story. This memoir is more about McConaughey’s upbringing and the lessons and fun he had along the way. Though he mentions his films and acting, this book brings to readers his experiences and philosophies about living a fulfilling life and enjoying the experiences as they happen.	4.0 out of 5 stars
One best and funniest and realistic books of our modern age..reading seems like you re reading about a good friend and what they been thur ..Matthew even says at the beginning of the book don’t take this book to heart or a guide ,but in ways you live thur his experience of what he when thur ..just keep living ..bumper sticker ..	5.0 out of 5 stars
Going in depth to his life he tells the story of his childhood through 50 with all the adventures, learning, epiphanies, understandings and different viewpoints of his life and the things happening around him. Buy it, read it. You won't be disappointed. I was gifted this book by a good friend of mine in a dark and depressing time, and this really lifted me up... Greenlight.  I've bought this for no less than 3 people this Christmas.	5.0 out of 5 stars
The book is a quick read giving you some insight into the actor. I clearly remember him in a time to kill. I had read the book and loved it and hope that the movie would be as good. It was. I remember saying that Matthew was going to be a big name in movies.	3.0 out of 5 stars
Read it cover to cover in one go and I never saw this side of Mathew. I thought he was living in a cult of Hollywood but the guy is actually far more than just some puppet actor. He is intelligent, genius, know more about life than 99% of the other celebs living in delusion. A man like him needs to live far away from the fakelights of tinsel town. I stopped watching Hollywood ever since they went political, but if this guy makes even a cell phone movie, I am watching.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I was sceptical, however intrigued by the description of the content. There were scenes that were a *little* to graphic for me, but also seemed necessary to get the full picture of his story. On the flipside, it's endearing for him to ultimately be very normal (and I'm not a fan of that word), in spite of his very un-normal upbringing.	4.0 out of 5 stars
First book I have read in a long time. He is very insightful. I also listened to Matthew read it to me on audible. He added even more insight into his own story and listening to his reaction at times was hilarious. He also acted out accents. Definitely recommend this and on audible too.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I read so many good review of this book, I was eager to read / listen to it myself.  I got the audible version, but stopped listening after the first 45 minutes.  The story is engaging, but the language was awful.  I would love to listen to him read a "watered down" version without all of the foul language.	2.0 out of 5 stars
I didn't want the book, I wanted to HEAR the man talk! He could talk about dirt and I'd listen! He is Golden. I have watched every show and movie. He and Kate Hudson are magic together. Listening to bits of his life is an extraordinary thing because he is an extraordinary human being.	5.0 out of 5 stars
My daughter bought the book and I ended up taking her copy and reading it first! I absolutely loved it! A perfect proportion of spirituality, entertainment, travel, biography, an insider view of the movie industry...	5.0 out of 5 stars
I absolutely LOVE this book. I’ve been a fan of Matthew for a while now and I am so happy I purchased this book. It’s so raw and authentic. He does a great job of story telling. I highly recommend the audio version where Matthew narrates it himself, he does the Australian accents for Norvel Dooley and his family. It’s incredible.	5.0 out of 5 stars
We can now extend the list....Socrates, Plato, Pascal, Kant, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Camus....and... McConaughey!!	1.0 out of 5 stars
UNBELIEVABLY GOOD.  Honest, funny, heart breaking, GREAT INSPIRATION.  Highly recommend the audio version AND print version.  You need to hear his voice.  You need to see his words.  You'll go back to this again and again.  IT'S THAT GOOD.  Loved it!!!!  Have recommended to so many people....... so much wisdom and thought and GREEN LIGHTS.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I enjoyed this autobiography BUT with caveat. There were (what I took to be) writings within the writing that I soon started skipping over as they were boring to me. Just telling his story would have been enough without the tangents which (to me) did not fit. They appeared to be self-aggrandizing bits of McConaughy's philosophies.	4.0 out of 5 stars
How do you rate a man's life? Or his sharing of his life story? It's not for me to decide, really.  I did thoroughly enjoy a look at an actor whom I have enjoyed watching on the big screen and little screen and learning about his life and how he has chosen to live it.  His upbringing is not what I had expected, but that's neither good nor bad.  It just is! The decisions he has made throughout his life are his own and he stands by them and for me that is commendable. I enjoyed the optimism that greenlights are really just how we choose to view any situation we are given in life.  May I have more greenlights in my life!!!	5.0 out of 5 stars
I always had mixed feelings about Matthew.  From the outside looking in, he seemed a flawed artist.  This book explains him beautifully.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Well written thought out story of his life to date, the good, bad, ugly, and the really funny.  I believe to truly appreciate this book, listen to it on Audible.  Matthew's own narration with the passion, excitement, and honest in his voice as he tells the stories of his youth are wonderful to hear.  It is a well-grounded  masterpiece of life!	5.0 out of 5 stars
I really wanted to like this & have enjoyed him. But if I have to hear ‘Note to self’ again in the tone he says it I am going to lose it. Seemed self absorbed was looking for a little more humility. Too cute, I can could handle small sample of him but got old pretty quick.  Like someone u like around for a few hours but then annoy the hell out of u & u have to separate.	3.0 out of 5 stars
I’m so sad that’s I just finished listening to your book! I absolutely LOVED it! I’ve always admired you. Thank you for writing this book and for letting us get to know YOU. I throughly enjoyed. every. minute. of it and love that you chose to be the voice for the audible book! Not every author does. It was so satisfying listening to you say “greenlight” as I’d approach one while driving! Thank you. “Keep Livin” and seeking God. -Rachel Peach	5.0 out of 5 stars
Need both, sorry. I listened to the sample and it's great. I scrolled through the book sample and it's great. But the two together would be how it should be. Like how he says, or might say, I'm learning to own more patience. I'll wait for what's right before I jump just to have what's 'right now'.	5.0 out of 5 stars
This is a great book. It reads in a way I was hoping he thought. A very interesting life, and perspective to sit back and appreciate.	5.0 out of 5 stars

When I first opened my delivery I thought the dust cover was defective because it’s at least in inch shorter than the book. Very, very unusual. I don’t care for this. Therefore one star. I haven’t started reading the book. It’s a gift for someone else so I can’t comment on the content. My first impression wasn’t good because of the short book jacket. Why? Is this a move to save on the cost of producing?	1.0 out of 5 stars
Far more creative and insightful than I ever imagined it could be.  The stories are entertaining, a bit surprising and it was fun just learning about how the wins in his life came to be.  I listened to the Audible version which I highly recommend.  A fun look at one of America's favorite movie stars.	5.0 out of 5 stars
This book is wild and you must read. Now, it's not necessarily a good book per se. It is pretentious and goofy and I am pretty sure McConaughey is making at least some of this up. But it is compulsively readable and a lot of fun. In short, it feels like a balm for our current world.	4.0 out of 5 stars
Good pretty quick read but the notes etc were difficult to see/read  He has led an interesting life.  Hard to red the notes me then get back to where I was.	3.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew is an excellent writer, who knew? I absolutely enjoyed his story. Not realizing what a down-to-earth, funny guy he is. I listened to this through Audible, which was fantastic and charismatic read by him. It was like he was telling the story vs reading a book out loud. Enjoy!	5.0 out of 5 stars
I LOVED this book!!! I did it on Audible because - well because he read it to me. :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:. He has lead a very different life that most fans don’t know about. He doesn’t hold back lays the good and bad out there. Great listen.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I absolutely loved the first half to two-thirds of this book. It was interesting and, in places, very funny...then it seemed to take a turn to "weird."  I really loved MM previously. It's sad that while I still like him, after reading his book I like him less.	4.0 out of 5 stars
Most inspiring book I've listened to in a long time. Makes me want to watch his movies from a new light.	5.0 out of 5 stars

I am not the type of person that particularly enjoys reading memoirs. I heard about this book from a podcast and was very excited to find out that Matthew McConaughey himself did the audiobook. It is wonderfully enjoyable and real life honest. His focus is not on the Hollywood lifestyle but rather on the nitty gritty life experiences and serendipitous parts of life that make it all worth it. There is a lot to learn from his experiences and I cannot emphasize enough how honest it is of the blunders and wins in life. Truly worth taking the time to enjoy and there is something for everyone to learn and be inspired by.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I listened to the Audiobook driving back and forth to work. There are some great life lessons, stolen moments, and fantastic stories in this book. Well worth buying. I may even buy the print version so I can highlight and go back over time.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I heard him on new Howard Stern interview and 2 min into it - I ordered the audio-book and plowed thru immediately.  He’s evolved into a great actor and a wicked interesting dude too boot.  Either way - he’s a fantastic story teller...... Highly recommend.......	5.0 out of 5 stars
Fantastically written and read. This book is so much better hearing it read by Matthew.	5.0 out of 5 stars
What a wonderful book!  Once I started reading it, I could not put it down.  I found him to be very down to earth and a guy that is always searching.  I felt like I went on his trips too.  Very well written.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I appreciate his honesty and humility. Not many authors, especially autobiographers, are willing to express their inner thoughts to provide more context to their content.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Listened to this on Audible and it was a breath of fresh air.  Not trying to be self help but definitely gets you to stop and think “what am I learning here” and “how is this negative a possible green light to positive soon.” Loved it.	5.0 out of 5 stars
What a treat it was to listen to this brilliant actor and author read in his captivating Texas twang the words he brilliantly strung together to present the fascinating story of his life to this point. You'll laugh a lot and perhaps shed a tear or two, but you'll NEVER be bored. Despite his loud, clear reading throughout the book, you'll want to keep the volume up at all times because McConaughey speaks very softly, almost whispering, in many instances. His candor will amaze you. It may even shock you. His tales prove once again that truth can be stranger than fiction AND far more interesting.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Loved loved loved this Audiobook!!	5.0 out of 5 stars
This book was very insightful into the person, views, beliefs, and understanding of Matthew McConaughey. While I enjoyed hearing his philosophies, it was hard to remedy his belief system with what is believed to be true and has given me much to think about. I think 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 has much to say. I would love to sit down one day and discuss this with him and his wife, if I was ever given the chance. Cheers Matthew and thanks for the good read.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Very well written and it keeps you in awe of the adventurous and inspiring life Matthew has had ! This book was definitely a greenlight for me :green_heart:	5.0 out of 5 stars
Only Matthew could read his book.  I really enjoy listening to him tell the story.  Very positive story in a crazy way.  I know now why he wrote the book and I understand him much better now.  Love it!	5.0 out of 5 stars
This book was the biggest waste of money and time.  I am disgusted by the lack of seriousness taken by him on things like domestic violence, child abuse, drug use, stealing, pornography, masturbation, etc.; things that cause major harm to individuals and families alike.  I would NOT recommend this book at all.	1.0 out of 5 stars
I just finished the Audible version. I went into it thinking that I would at least enjoy listening to his voice for 6.5 hours.  I found myself smiling and laughing out loud throughout the entire book.  Also I kept replaying segments so I could soak up his little nuggets of wisdom and insight.  I thoroughly enjoyed this listen. Not sure that I would have liked it as much in book format.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I had no idea what to expect but I have total respect for the kind of man MM is.  He is not your romcom man in the movies.  He is deep, he is respectful, he is faith filled, he is a family man.	5.0 out of 5 stars

I have always like Matthew McConaughey but this book made me have a different view of him. Really enjoyed his writing style. I felt as if he was sitting in front of me telling me his story. He is a great storyteller. He has a lot of great quotes throughout the book, but I really liked this one... “I haven’t made all A’s in the art of livin, but I give a damn, and I’ll take an experienced C over an ignorant A any day.”	5.0 out of 5 stars
Awesome book	5.0 out of 5 stars
This might be my first Amazon review...ever. But I had to chime in with how amazing this read (or even better, listen) is. It’s laugh out loud, insightful, and deep with great nuggets of advice and wisdom. I listened to it on audible because he narrates and it’s nothing short of amazing. For those who left bad or so/so reviews I’d recommend this route as he’s a great story teller. I just bought a hard copy though because I just have to have a physical copy! Love, love, love!	5.0 out of 5 stars
Great to listen to. Almost a autobiography. The fact Mathew does the reading makes it! If someone else narrated it, it would not be worth listening to.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Wow! Entertaining + witty + higher-level thinking = pure gold. What an honor to get a peek into a mind as brilliant as Matthew’s. I rank this up there with Jen Sincero’s Badass series, Brooke Castillo’s Life Coaching podcast, and various other motivational self-help books, podcasts and mindsets. Absolutely loved it. Totally worth the read {or listen}!	5.0 out of 5 stars
If you have always wanted to sit on a porch, drink a cold beer with Matthew and just talk all night, this book is it!

I don’t read a lot of memoirs, but I like McConaughey’s work, so I decided to give this one a go. It’s a unique sort of memoir in the sense that it’s a little bit of an autobiography and a little bit of a spiritual or self-help read; McConaughey peppers wisdom in alongside his life's adventures.	4.0 out of 5 stars
Sometimes I honestly find memoirs and biographies a bit self indulgent and “eye rolly” because, well, they can be!  However, in this case, I was pleasantly surprised. A memoir with a message, Greenlights encapsulated this actor’s life experiences thru a pragmatic journal-like style, and felt down-to-earth and not pretentious. I liked the spiritual aspect being a Christian myself, but felt compelled also by his humanity and connections to the world around him. His childhood stories are hilarious and immediately made me want to buy for my dad (he is one of three boys and has a tough old bird as a mom) so figured he’d definitely get a kick out of the story. Enjoyed this book a lot.	4.0 out of 5 stars
I bought this as an audiobook.  I listen to it in the car and occasionally, in my favorite chair.  I truly enjoy listening to him reading his own book.  His joy, sadness, humor and so many emotions show through and make the book much more enjoyable.  I loved his honesty and thoughts on what he discovered about himself and just living.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Ok book and it was just one thing to say about this game and I think that the most important part was the best	4.0 out of 5 stars
About what I expected. It was kind of boring.	3.0 out of 5 stars
Beautifully written and narrated by Matthew McConaughey, I have both the audiobook and the hardback on release date so listening to the voice I was able to look at the images, scans, photos and handwritten notes contained in the book as well.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Could not put it down-always a sure sign of a good read. But it is so much more. McConaughey's reflections on life, of himself, of the world he lives in speak to the heart, make you take pause and do a little internal reflection for yourself.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I’ve been a fan of Matthew McConaughey for a few years now - even though I still struggle to say his name correctly.	5.0 out of 5 stars
It would've been good to actually be able to read it properly, the words are so small on kindle edition and you can't change it. Matthew sounds like a great guy but book just didnt do it for me!	2.0 out of 5 stars
The writing is terrible- like it was done by a young child.	1.0 out of 5 stars
An excellent read from beginning to end, so interesting to get a glimpse into Matthews extraordinary life and to learn from his experiences. 50 years worth of trials, tribulations and lessons from a man who has attained the perceived unattainable. Why wouldn’t you want to discover them greenlights? Cheers Matthew.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I'm not sure what I was expecting from a book written Matthew McConnaughy.  The analogy of 'Know Your Style' was good.  However,  I suspect this was written by somebody else.  The scrawled poems (which, lets be honest, are not going to ignite much intelligence) do not align with the text.  It's as if someone has reviewed his notes, listened to his lilting accent, and manufactured a book.  The merchandise that is now being promoted on social media compounds my suspicion that this is certainly not a genuine memoir.	1.0 out of 5 stars
What a great guy, definitely not your average Hollywood actor. Very insightful and full of heart. Also, a fun read. And now  to buy the audible.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Good book, more guide than biography but one that makes you think and perhaps do a little reassessing. Would recommend	5.0 out of 5 stars
I've really loved reading this book. It usually takes me quite a long time to read books, yet I read almost half of this in one night as I just couldn't put it down! Really nice to read about his life and makes you put things in to perspective on things that have happened in our own lives... "green lights" everywhere when we see things with opportunity and put ourselves out there like he did on numerous occasions. Easy read and really enjoyed it.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Greenlights great Title.  We all have them + the red n Amber lights too.  Love reading when someone follows their dreams and they come true.  Could be any one of us but unfortunately lots of us get stuck at Amber.  Loved this thought provoking inspiring spiritual  family and Geography  lessons too all rolled into one. Lots of funny moments too.  Glad I read it. Now working towards my own  Greenlights.	5.0 out of 5 stars
After eagerly awaiting this book, I was, totally, and utterly disappointed.  It is rubbish.	1.0 out of 5 stars
Home spun BS and middle class pretentious mixed with a few good stories.  Strictly for MM fans or anyone who loves self-help books.  Shame, if the missus had written this review it would have been 5 stars, I bought it for her birthday, but sadly when she has been working night shifts the last 6 weeks, I have been dipping in and out of this.  I should have done a crossword or two instead.  The best way I can describe this would be Forrest Gump, with a college degree.	3.0 out of 5 stars
A very overhyped book. Wasn't a terrible read but only half the book was actually writing (so about 120 pages). The rest was a series of drawings of notes that at first glance could be thought of as insightful quotes but are actually embarrassingly trite. Might be good as a holiday book if you want something extremely lightweight to read quickly that doesn't actually say anything of great interest.	2.0 out of 5 stars
I am currently reading this book, I thought I’d been conned at first as it does not open and start like a conventional read, although it did eventually get to a traditional read, it’s been really entertaining, completely eye opening and enjoyable to read. I am a great fan and admirer of Matthew McConaughey so loving his mad cap family stories and philosophies. I would recommend	5.0 out of 5 stars
Inspiring and honest. One of those books that will stick with you for life. Matthew is a brilliant story teller with some really great messages throughout.	5.0 out of 5 stars
I am not one for biographies and motivational books usually but am in a middle of a personal journey and the blurb looked good. Within a few minutes of starting the book I was hooked and found the subject matter and message so compelling that I finished the book quickly. Lessons learnt, values and the message can be applied to any life situation regardless of what your requirements are. The style is relaxed and easy to read, and the selection of stories fabulous. Have recommended to several friends who have started to read this and have very similar opinions on it.	5.0 out of 5 stars
An amazing journey with Matthew McConaughey which had me captured from the first page to the last page.  I love the honesty and no frills look at the journey Matthew took. No sugar coating just the real and raw facts encountered from naked drum playing or Mrs Hud. Thank you for sharing your lessons learnt.	5.0 out of 5 stars

Just as I finished the book in a very disappointingly quick read, I thought I had finally reached the meat of the book, the real story or chapters, only to find......., it had ended!  Took about an hour to read?  I can't believe I paid nearly $16AU for that!  I was really looking forward to a good read of a good Memoir.  Seems to me, to be something just to generate income in his life.  It was SO hard to read on Kindle.  Painful to read on Kindle, painfully short, painful waste of money.  I warned my sister in time before she shelled out precious bucks for this book.  I'm sorry to be leaving such a negative review, when I was so looking forward to reading this much publicized book by an Actor I enjoy.	1.0 out of 5 stars

Great book with so much to take out of it. Amazon please do something about the Kindle Edition, the words are way too small and can not be enlarged? Otherwise, this would get a 5 star.	4.0 out of 5 stars
Haven’t felt this sad to finish a book in a while. Although it takes a while to read, it - for me - shifted how I not only approach everyday life but go about contemplating my future heavily. It’s great fun and you can’t help but try to read it in Matthew’s voice every now and then. Give it a try.	5.0 out of 5 stars
This is a phenomenal book. McConaughey's way of writing allows you to step into his shoes. It's going to be hard for you to put the book down. It is an unconventional memoir, the book has an atypical structure (index, vignettes and others), it also contains excerpts from the author's journal he's written over the years which I think contributes to the "realness" of this book. I was a bit skeptical at first, but I was (gladly) proven wrong. Grab a copy, you won't regret it. McConaughey is a talented storyteller. Well done!	5.0 out of 5 stars
What a piercing insight into a human who will always be a work in progress. Deliberately. I am 72, but I will wait for the next instalment. In the meantime I will pick up the positivity and try to rebrand myself.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Awesome book, however it showed up with a mangled slip cover.	5.0 out of 5 stars
What a true writer and poet, man of many talents.  He has always been my favorite actor and I love the authenticity of himself in this book, the way he was raised, how he looks at life and how we all should recognize red, yellow or green lights in the different phases of our lives.  Positive enthusiasm and a zest for life in general, it's a book to read during these times of living in a pandemic.  It will put a smile on your face and truly make you reflect on your own life and how we view and live it.  Will probably re-read over and over, it was that good.  Well Done Mr. Mcconaughey!! All right, all right and ALL RIGHT!!!	5.0 out of 5 stars
I can appreciate a different approach to a traditional book layout but if it comes with the cost of readability/ legibility of the content it’s not my cup of tea. I sadly returned the book after not even having finished a single page. A bummer I was quite excited about the release.	1.0 out of 5 stars
Unique, laugh-out-loud funny and inspiring. This book not only entertains with cool stories told in Matthews lyrical way, but reminds us to honestly examine ourselves and our lives as we go and course correct where necessary. A thoroughly enjoyable memoir.	5.0 out of 5 stars

A truly intelligent,  arty and humorous  Bio, well worth reading.	5.0 out of 5 stars
Matthew McConaughey's extraordinary life is larger than any character he's ever played. His  boldness and willingness to take risks has taken him places outside the realm of the everyday. Thankfully McConaughey is as self aware as he is a soulful, cosmic wanderer,  distilling truths that will resonate and inspire us mere mortals. He's also a hell of a storyteller, but when the grist is this juicy, it's perhaps not that hard. A mythmaker by trade, McConaughey spits truths for a livin.	5.0 out of 5 stars

Struggled with this book quite a lot, he comes across kind of pretentious and uses a lot of words to say not very much. Some interesting/well told stories in there but I would say about 70% of the book is filler. If you're a big fan of him you might like it but otherwise, not one I would recommend!	2.0 out of 5 stars
Am i doing something wrong? I can't amplify the font size, neither highlight sentences. it's kinda uncomfortable, if you have sight issues do not order the kindle edition. that's the only reason i gave 3 stars, really. Other than that, the book is pretty good so far. (5/5)	3.0 out of 5 stars
